                        Purchased item on Final Sale according to listed size chart and item is huge. Customer rep was sympathetic, offered discount for additional purchase, but refused to exchange for size. Size charts clearly listed for item, yet product received not even close. A wonderful Fanatics rep reached out to understand what happened and kindly returned the money we spent on the purchase even though they couldnâ€™t take the item back. Very grateful for the support and service -Robin Black</td>
